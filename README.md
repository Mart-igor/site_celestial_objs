To demonstrate my skills and abilities, I created a website.  
The following features have been implemented:  
1. The site consists of several ***apps*** that do their job  
-- **main** - *display of celestial objects (taking into account their categories)*  
-- **cart** - *display of shopping list*  
-- **users** - *interaction with users (login, logout, registration)*  
-- **orders** - *create order*  
-- **payment** - *payment for goods*
2. When creating ***templates*** I used:  
-- **html5**  
-- **jinja**  
- *to make the templates look beautiful I used:*  
-- **bootstrap**  
-- **css**  
-- **cdnjs**
3. To populate the ***database*** I used:  
-- **ORM**  
-- **admin-panel**  
-- **PostgreSQL**
4. In order to be able to roll back in case of a fatal error (actually mostly as an artificial ***team experience***), I used:  
-- **Git & GitHub**
